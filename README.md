# Victorian-Road-Crash-Analysis
This project analyzes and visualizes road crash data from Victoria, Australia, spanning 2012 to 2024. The dataset provides insights into accidents based on factors such as time, location, accident type, severity, road geometry, and lighting conditions. The goal is to explore, clean, and visualize the data to uncover patterns and irregularities while gaining a better understanding of accident trends.

## Features
**Data Cleaning and Irregularities Detection**
1. Irregularities Identification: Visualize and identify data irregularities using Tableau Public/Desktop.
2. Error Handling: Correct irregularities using tools such as Python, R, or Excel.

**Data Exploration and Analysis**
1. Temporal Analysis: Analyze accident trends over time (hour, day, month, year) and uncover patterns in accident frequency and severity.
2. Geographical Analysis: Explore where accidents occur geographically, focusing on road geometry, speed zones, and urban/rural classification.

**Visualization**
1. Create interactive and static visualizations using Tableau to support data exploration and communicate findings effectively.

## Tools and Technologies
1. Tableau Public/Desktop: For data visualization and exploration.
2. R Shiny: Interactive dashboard
3. Python/R/Excel: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
4. Dataset Source: Vehicle Road Crash Data from the Victorian Department of Transport and Planning.
